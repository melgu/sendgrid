Adds a mail backend for SendGrid to the Vapor web framework. Send simple emails,
or leverage the full capabilities of SendGrid's V3 API.

## Setup
Add the dependency to Package.swift:

~~~~swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/sendgrid.git", from: "4.0.0")
~~~~

Make sure `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set in your environment. This can be set in the
Xcode scheme, or specified in your `docker-compose.yml`, or even provided as
part of a `swift run` command.

Optionally, explicitly initialize the provider (this is strongly recommended, as
otherwise a missing API key will cause a fatal error some time later in your
application):

~~~~swift
app.sendgrid.initialize()
~~~~

Now you can access the client at any time:
~~~~swift
app.sendgrid.client
~~~~

## Using the API

You can use all of the available parameters here to build your `SendGridEmail`
Usage in a route closure would be as followed:

~~~~swift
import SendGrid

let email = SendGridEmail(â€¦)

try await req.application.sendgrid.client.send(email)
~~~~

## Error handling

If the request to the API failed for any reason a `SendGridError` is thrown and has an `errors` property that contains an array of errors returned by the API:

~~~~swift
do {
		try await req.application.sendgrid.client.send(email)
} catch let error as SendGridError {
		req.logger.error("\(error)")
}
~~~~
